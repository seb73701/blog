# How to build docs in GitHub without GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools #2599

If GitHub Actions cannot be utilized, you can manually deploy your MkDocs project to GitHub Pages by following these steps:

## 1. Local Environment Setup:

- Ensure that you have Python and MkDocs installed on your local machine.
- Clone your GitHub repository to your local machine if it’s not already.

## 2. Build the Project:

- Open a terminal and navigate to your MkDocs project directory.
- Run the command `mkdocs build`. This will generate a `site` directory containing the built website.

## 3. Prepare for Deployment:

- Create a new branch in your repository named `gh-pages` if it doesn’t already exist.
- Delete everything in the `gh-pages` branch, as the new build will replace it.

```shell
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
```

## 4. Move Built Files:

- Move the contents of the `site` directory to the root of your repository.

```shell
mv site/* .
rmdir site
```

## 5. Commit and Push:

- Commit the changes and push the `gh-pages` branch to GitHub.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages
```

## 6. Configure GitHub Pages:

- Go to the settings of your GitHub repository.
- Navigate to the Pages section and select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.

Your MkDocs documentation should now be accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`. Remember to repeat steps 2-5 every time you update your documentation.
