# 6 Python Projects You Can Finish in a Weekend
**Beginner and advanced projects that will help you level up your Python code**


Learning Python can be difficult. You might spend a lot of time watching videos and reading books; however, if you can’t put all the concepts learned into practice, that time will be wasted.

This is why you should get your hands dirty with Python projects. A project will help you bring together everything you’ve learned, stay motivated, build a portfolio and come up with ways of approaching problems and solving them with code.

In this article, I listed some projects that helped me level up my Python code and hopefully will help you too. The projects are listed by difficulty, so the beginner projects are in the beginning, while the advanced projects are at the end of the article.

## Rock, Paper, Scissor
Rock paper scissors is a classic game I’m sure you’re familiar with. It’s a simple hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. With this beginner project, we’ll learn how to implement the basic Python stuff like lists, if statements, and inputs.

The goal is to create a system so that a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors but will lose to one who has played paper and a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors. If this project looks interesting to you, check this [guide](https://betterprogramming.pub/3-fun-beginner-python-projects-with-random-numbers-df12c84a621) that includes the full Python code of this project.

This is the simplest game you can code in Python. After finishing this project, you can develop more complex games with computer graphics and sound libraries with the Pygame library. Some of the games you can create with Pygame are listed below.

- Tic Tac Toe
- Hangman
- Guessing Number
- Quiz Game
- Snake


## File Renaming Tool

Most jobs require you to sort folders by date or manage file names with a pre-defined syntax. You can do this manually; however, you could save a lot of time with some Python code.

The goal of this project is to rename hundreds of files stored on the computer so it will be easy to recognize each file. For example, you could add the date the file was created in the format “MM-DD-YY” to the file name so anyone could easily locate a file.

To make this possible in Python, we have to use the OS module that comes with Python. This provides functions for interacting with your operating system, so it allows you to control many functionalities with Python code. This [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/7-common-file-system-operations-you-can-do-with-python-e4670c0d92f2) will help you get started with the OS module. 

Another library that comes in handy for this project is a built-in package called re. This package allows you to work with [regular expressions](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-and-intuitive-guide-to-regular-expressions-404b057b1081) that you might need in case there are some text patterns you want to extract and reuse in your file name.

Other operating system tasks you can do with the OS library are:

- Create multiple folders and rename them
- Remove a directory
- Identify the current working directory

You can learn how to do this and other tasks in the guide below.

## Spreadsheet Automation
Repetitive tasks like updating an Excel reporting take a lot of our time. Fortunately, Python’s library openpyxl will help us automate most tasks we have to do in Excel.

The idea of this project is to use Python code to perform Excel tasks such as making a pivot table, plotting a chart, applying Excel formulas, and formatting the report sheet. Once we finish writing the code, we just have to run the script to create a report like the one below.

You could even create a Python function, [convert your Python script to an executable file (.exe)](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-convert-a-python-script-to-an-executable-file-exe-4966e253c7e9) and [schedule the Python script](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-automate-your-python-scripts-on-mac-and-windows-459388c9cc94) to create a report monthly, weekly, or daily.

A guide on how to automate your Excel reporting can be found on the link below.

## Creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

Writing Python code is cool but you know what’s even cooler? Being able to interact with your code through a graphical user interface, so anyone can test what you’ve developed.

Python’s libraries Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivi will help you create a GUI with buttons, windows, and lots of other widgets that make it easier for the user to interact with your application. If you’ve never created a GUI before, you can check this free [Tkinter course](https://youtu.be/YXPyB4XeYLA).

The idea of this project is simple — create a GUI of any project you already finished. You can also create a GUI of the projects listed in this article or get some inspiration from the following list.
- Age calculator app: This app allows users to type their date of birth, and the app will display their age automatically.
- Calculator: If you ever developed a calculator while learning Python, now it’s time to enhance the output with a GUI. Get some inspiration from the calculator that comes with your operating system.
- Currency converter: Build a currency converter app that allows users to input the desired value in one currency and returns the converted value in the target currency.

## Build a Simple Portfolio Website

If you ever dreamed about creating a website, I have good news, you can do it with Python! Two of the most popular framework for web development in Python are Django and Flask.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean design. 

It’s fast, scalable, and takes security seriously so that’s why websites like Instagram, Pinterest, and The Washington Post were built with Django. On the other hand, Flask is a lightweight framework that offers the basic features of a web app. It requires less coding, so it’s an excellent framework for learning web development fundamentals.

A cool project for beginners in Django is to build a basic portfolio resume website to showcase your work. Your first website won’t look like those modern websites with good-looking design; however, with this project, you’ll learn the basics like rendering a template, adding in static files for CSS, JavaScript, and images. Check this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/pLN-OnXjOJg) to have a better idea of this project.

If you wish to dig deeper into Flask or Django, check out [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DennisIvy/videos) or this [other channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5), where there are complete tutorial series for both frameworks.


## Movie Recommendation System

Have you ever wondered how streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon recommend a new movie to watch? It’s just a recommendation system built by engineers that finds the best movie based on different information about users.

A recommendation system is a program that aims to predict the preference of a user towards a specific item. In this case, the recommendation system predicts movies a user would like to watch given some data. In Python, we can use libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn to develop a recommendation engine from basic models to content-based and collaborative filtering recommender systems.

To carry out this project, you will need a dataset with movie titles and at least a plot description. You can use this [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) dataset or this [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset for this project. Also, in this [link](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python), there’s a complete guide on how to make your movie recommendation system in Python.
