# 5 Useful Python One-Liners That Can Be Understood By Beginners
Do you want to improve your productivity as a developer? With these 5 Python one-liners, you will be able to write concise code.


Nowadays Iâ€™m learning a lot about programming (with JavaScript and Python), and Iâ€™m solving many challenges in coding exercises for websites. As a result of this, Iâ€™m seeing a lot of different solutions and Iâ€™m obsessed with optimizing my solutions and trying to find creative solutions beyond ifs and loops.

In addition to that, Python is a very powerful language that allows us to solve problems with fewer lines than using other languages such as Java or C++. For this reason, I started adding one-liners to my Python code some time ago. And in this article, Iâ€™ve come up with 5 Python one-liners really useful for beginners and very easy to follow for you to get started in this fantastic world of one-liners.

What? Donâ€™t you know exactly what is a one-liner in Python? Let me explain it:

What is a one-liner code?
A one-liner code is, as the name says, a code that occupies only one line. Imagine that you compress a block of code in a way that it fits inside only one line, it will be a one-liner. You can solve specified problems in a concise and packed way in just one single line.

But be careful if you use it because you could write complex one-liners that anybody can understand. If you use or create one-liners that are complex, confusing, and difficult to understand, itâ€™s better not to use them. However, if you use well and easy-to-understand one-liners it will be as if you have superpowers

And this is not a little-known practice or one that only the most intelligent can understand. There are one-liners in almost every language and itâ€™s a really widespread practice. Thereâ€™s even a programming subculture that enjoys a lot of writing the shortest code for a given problem.

Should you use one-liners in your project? Check their benefits and decide for yourself:

Benefits of knowing and using one-liners
Using one-liners, although you can find different opinions on the Internet, is a programming practice that can give us a lot of benefits, for example:

They are a good way to find creative solutions to problems.
Some languages such as Python allow us to create great one-liners of code.
Your code will be clear if you use the correct one-liner.
You will reduce the lines of code that you have to write.
Being capable of writing one-liner statements is incredibly fun.
Youâ€™re going to feel really smart when you understand them totally.
You will discover some language features in order to give a more concise solution (such as array methods, lambda function, ternary operator, etc).
Additionally, if you can understand correctly one-liner statements youâ€™re going to learn about the language and you will become a better developer.

Think about it for a moment, if you canâ€™t understand or write a one-liner statement, how can you ever hope to understand or write more complicated lines?

Already looking forward to using this practice in your code? Here are my 5 one-liners for beginners that you will understand very easily:

## 1. Swapping
Are you currently swapping two variables using 3 instructions and an auxiliary var? Stop doing this! Here is one way to do it with only one line:

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a , b) # 1 , 2
```

```python
a , b = b , a # One liner
print(a , b) # 2 , 1
```

## 2. Checking if a String is a Palindrome
If youâ€™ve been in the last few days solving programming exercises, youâ€™ve probably had to check if a string is a Palindrome. Here you have the corresponding one-liner:

By the way! Let me gift you my favorites websites to solve coding challenges:



## 3. Creating and Filling a List
Imagine that your boss requests you to create a list and fill it with twice the first 10 natural numbers. How would you do it?

The correct answer isâ€¦ Using this one-liner:

## 4. Convert List to String
A very usual problem that we have to face in our daily job or when weâ€™re solving coding challenges is to transform a list into a string or vice versa. How would be your life if you could do it in only one line?

## 5. Reverse a List
Yeah, the classic problem that appears in your nightmares has come back. But donâ€™t worry, you donâ€™t have to reverse a linked list, only a normal list.

This first-liner was the one with which I discover the wonderful world of one-liners.

## Final Thoughts
Python is one of the most popular programming languages among developers. With this language, we can do the same things as in other languages but in a more concise way. Taking advantage of this power of the language and using one-liners we can improve as developers and compete in competitive programming as well.

Nevertheless, we canâ€™t forget the importance of making our code readable and understandable. We have to use this practice carefully and never think we are the smartest in the room.

In this article, Iâ€™ve discovered to you 5 Python one-liners that I like so much and which can be understood by beginners. I hope they help you as much as they have helped me to improve my code.

Did you know about this practice before? Do you use one-liners in your daily job?

## Conclusions ðŸ‘‹
Thank you! Thank you so much for reading the article. Iâ€™d love to know your opinion about it, so donâ€™t dude write it in the comments, Iâ€™ll read you.

In turn, if this article has helped you remember that you can give it a clap and share it with your comrades. And donâ€™t forget to follow me if you donâ€™t want to miss any of my articles.
