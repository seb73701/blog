There are two ways to get a decent job in IT:

1. With a certificate
1. With knowledge and the projects you have built

In my opinion, projects speak louder than certificates. In this article, we are going to see 12 Python project ideas for your resume. Every idea is from a different domain and contains some information about the different projects you can build in it.
First, remember one thing:
> “A project is complete when it starts working for you, rather than you working for it.” — Scott Allen

## 1. Desktop Assistant
A desktop assistant can be a good project for your resume. It shows the interviewer how wise you are. You know how to use resources and make something good with them.

You don’t have to be very technical or an advanced Python developer to create one. It can be created with just the help of a few different Python packages.

There are many available in Python that you can use, like Pyttsx3 for reading text, os for adding facilities like playing music or starting an application, Wikipedia for finding answers on the web, and more. Keep one thing in mind: Every package you use must provide a feature to your assistant.

You can even make your assistant more advanced by adding web scraping and automation facilities. 

Write a script that can scrape Google Search results. You can add this to your script to make it look more advanced.

This project has no end to it. The more features you add, the more professional and useful it becomes.

## 2. Website
Building a website for your resume is always a good idea. In Python, you have two options for creating a website. One is to create a normal website, like an e-commerce website, an educational platform, or something similar. The other more interesting feature is to create a website that does some tasks and can be used as it is in real life.

You can create a website that takes a list of emails and sends a custom email to each one of them with just one click. Or a website that takes a PDF file and converts it into an audio file.

There are lots of ideas that you can have and convert into reality.

## 3. Task Automater
This is similar to the first project but contains a piece of more detailed information.

You can write a script that can be used to automate some tasks — whether it is to organize your folders by renaming, removing, and moving files, a script that can log into different websites and perform marketing for your blogs and startup, or something different like a [Python script that sends birthday wishes to your friends](https://medium.com/pythoneers/python-script-that-sends-a-birthday-message-to-your-friends-c1aa1b52fe57).

There are many libraries that you can use like BeautifulSoup (web scraping), Selenium (web automation), win10toast (desktop notifications), os (organizing folders), etc.

You can see a list of automation tasks that you can perform in this [article](https://medium.com/pythoneers/21-automation-ideas-for-2021-616313fd5e96).

## 4. Game
Nothing is more satisfying than playing games. Building a game takes time and hard work, but if you can create a fully functional game, there is nothing better than that.

A developed game says a lot about the developer. It shows how creative and organized they are. It also shows that they have a strong grasp of programming concepts and OOP.

There are many Python libraries available to create games. You can check out [this list](https://betterprogramming.pub/7-must-try-python-libraries-to-build-apps-and-mobile-games-7e3f849721a) and choose which one is right for you.

## 5. Computer Vision Software
Computer vision is the trending tech of the 21st century. Every company is somehow implementing some sort of computer vision application. There are also tons of successful computer vision startups out there.

By building a computer vision model, you can show that you can easily adapt to new technologies and situations.

There are many options available for you to create a project in computer vision. You can choose to create a face recognition system, a disease detection system via X-ray images, or something helpful regarding traffic.

Python offers a wide range of libraries to perform computer vision tasks. Out of all the libraries, 
OpenCV is one of the best that you can use. Check out this [tutorial](https://pub.towardsai.net/learn-everything-about-open-cv-ed485a3007f1) to get some insight into the libraries.

## 6. GUI
GUI development is so useful and can be a great project for your resume. The graphical user interface is the one thing that the user sees and interacts with when they open your application.

You can go local and create a GUI for them. Just walk around your house, search for some local stores, and create GUI software for them according to their requirements. Remember, a good-looking GUI increases the reputation of your product and can also get you paid.

[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is the most famous Python library for creating GUIs. Sometimes, it can become a little hard to understand — especially if you are a beginner. There are still lots of great libraries that you can use to create amazing GUIs in Python. Check out [this list](https://betterprogramming.pub/7-must-try-gui-libraries-in-python-34c8f6266363).

## 7. Sentiment Analyzer App
A sentiment is a feeling or thought. [Sentiment analysis](https://medium.com/pythoneers/sentiment-analysis-web-app-using-nltk-and-heroku-96ccd37c44ef) is the study of subjective information in an expression. It is a field of Natural Language Processing that is used to determine whether the data is positive, negative, or neutral. It uses different NLP techniques to extract the sentiment from the text.

You can create a real-life-based project that can detect a customer's sentiment based on its review. Whether you choose restaurants, shopping malls, or an e-commerce website, it can be helpful to everyone.

You can predict when a company should put a sale or offer on some products. You can help them to grow their business and ultimately your own startup. If nothing else, it is still a good project to add to your resume.

There are many libraries available in Python for Natural Language Processing, but I like five in particular: NLTK, TextBlob, spacy, Gensim, and CoreNLP. You can learn more about them [in this article](https://betterprogramming.pub/5-must-try-python-libraries-for-natural-language-processing-91b37142ea5f) and decide which one you are going to choose.

## 8. Web Crawler
A web crawler or spider is an internet bot that systematically browses the web and extracts data from it.

You can create a web crawler that extracts data from different shopping websites, compares them, and returns the lowest price with a link to a product. You could also make a price tracker that tracks the price and sends an email when the price is dropped or a notifier that notifies the user whenever the sale is launched for a particular product.

By combining web crawling with a little bit of automation, you can come up with some out-of-this-world products that will boost your resume.

The best and simplest libraries for web crawling are Beautiful Soup and requests. Take a look at [this tutorial](https://medium.com/pythoneers/master-web-scraping-completly-from-zero-to-hero-38051423256b).

## 9. Algo Trader
This one is more than a project itself. It can be a moneymaker for you. You need to write a script that automatically sells or buys trades according to the price.

Beginners might find this hard to build. In short, you need to write a Python script that fetches the present and past stock value. The next step is to create a machine learning model that can predict the future stock value. After receiving future stock values, then you need to compare your predicted stock values with the real value that will appear in near future. Check the difference in values, and if it is not too much, then believe in yourself and start trading.

This project is definitely going to take a lot of time, but if you crack this one, it can single-handedly provide you with a decent job.

## 10. Create a Python Package
A Python package is basically a directory with different Python files that performs some task. 

Packages help developers to write less code by just importing one package. Every package in Python contains some actions that it can perform based on some instructions.

The best thing about Python is creating your own packages and sharing them with other developers using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

Creating a Python package does not require a lot of knowledge. You can easily create one by following tutorials on YouTube.

Some ideas that you can use:
- Create a Python package that cleans any type of text for NLP.
- Create a Python package that scrapes Google Search.
- Convert your automation script into a Python package for others to use.

## 11. Mobile Applications
One of the limitations of Python is that it can’t be used for making a mobile application. This is not 100% true, though. There are many libraries in Python that you can use to create mobile applications.

Kivy is one of them. It is a cross-platform library that can be used to create mobile applications for both Android and iOS.

Check out [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/) for insight into the library. Also, you can check out the [official docs](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/) for more details.

## 12. Make Data Analysis Easy
If you have a little bit of knowledge of the machine learning field, you must also have heard about data analysis.

It is the first phase of any machine learning project. If you have worked on any project related to data science, then you must have seen that the steps we take while preparing data for machine learning are the same in almost every problem — whether it is handling missing values, categorical data, or splitting data into training and testing sets.

These steps are common for each machine learning problem.

You can create a website that takes a dataset and returns a cleaned dataset by performing all the data analysis steps. All you need on the website are some sliders, dropdowns, and input fields for different choices.

You can use [streamlit](https://towardsdatascience.com/streamlit-101-an-in-depth-introduction-fc8aad9492f2) to create that website. It is an open source library that is specially designed for machine learning purposes. It can create awesome data apps with less code and effort.

## Final Thoughts
All the projects mentioned in this article are based purely on my thoughts. They can be developed with little effort and knowledge of the domain. If you find any of the projects useful and intend to create one of them, then let me know.
