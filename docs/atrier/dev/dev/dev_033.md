# 7 Underrated Landing Page Tips
Little tips I’ve discovered that improve conversion rates

Many factors go into an optimal landing page.

What are those factors? It’s more than a great offer and a clear headline. It’s more than stamping social proof on the page.

This is where copywriting helps improve conversions. Copywriting tweaks help sharpen the clarity of your message. Your readers understand more clearly what you’re offering them.

If you find your landing page has a low conversion rate and you don’t know what to do, then look at these copywriting tweaks.

I’ve discovered seven underrated tips that maximize landing page conversions.

## 1. Shorten the headline
Shorter headlines are faster to read. They are easier to understand.

Consider the power of these short headlines on websites:

- Go from zero to $1
- Start selling with Shopify
- One app to replace them all

They all have six words or fewer. They all roll off the tongue without any effort. Avoid stuffing as much information as you can in your headline.

A simple headline trick is to make a promise to the reader. Each of these headlines makes the simplest of promises.

## 2. Make the above-the-fold CTA easy to read
If your call to action isn’t identified, you’ve already lost the reader. You’ve lost a conversion.

On James Clear’s website, his CTA stands out among the white space. It’s seen. The color blends well together.

Don’t overcomplicate the design on your landing page or website. Make the form easy to see as soon as the reader lands on your page.

## 3. Use numbers in your social proof
Numbers are specific. They make what you say more believable because it’s a concrete fact. There’s nothing vague about numbers.

When Shopify tells you that 1,700,000 businesses trust them, you believe them. It’s better than saying a lot of businesses trust us.

## 4. Reduce form questions
Prospects won’t buy if there’s friction. This means if there’s any resistance between them and submitting a form.

Including a first name, last name, phone number, and more are unnecessary. You’re scaring people away with so many questions. To increase your landing page’s conversion rate, make it easy for the prospect to submit a form. Require less.

Justin Welsh is a solopreneur who only asks for a name. No more information. It’s that simple.

## 5. Write for one reader
Most landing pages try to reach everyone with vague, cookie-cutter language. By doing that, you’re only confusing your readers.

You need to talk to your one customer. Your one reader.

Look at how Freshbook does it on its website. They say what they offer and who they offer it to. There’s no room for confusion.

## 6. Solve one problem
Solving one problem for that one reader is another challenge. A mistake I see in landing pages is solving multiple problems for one reader.

Great landing pages focus on solving one big and specific problem for readers. Look at this example by Empower.

They solve a problem — bad credit. And they solve it for one reader — people with bad credit. It’s clear in the headline.

## 7. Know what action you want the reader to take
Tell your reader what exactly you are going to do for them. Spell it out on your landing page. You’re not trying to be clever, you’re trying to be helpful.

Each call to action tells the reader what to do next

- James Clear tells the reader to download the first chapter
- Gumroad tells you to start selling

These are better than vague calls to action that simply say Get Started or Next Step. Tell the reader exactly what will happen next.

It sets up expectations.

## See what works
Most landing pages are only a few copywriting tweaks from 10x the conversion rate.

Remember, you’re making tweaks for the reader. You want your landing page to be as clear as possible. The reader should understand if your offer is or isn’t for them.

Ultimately, the clarity of your message sells products.
