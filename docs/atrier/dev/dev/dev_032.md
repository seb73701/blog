User onboarding is the process of introducing new users to a product or service and helping them get started. This can include helpful guidance in the form of providing tutorials, walkthroughs, or welcome modals to help users learn the basics and start using a product or service effectively.

A well-designed user onboarding experience can help improve the user’s experience and increase the chances of them becoming a long-term user.

In fact, 60% of users find a bad onboarding experience a dealbreaker, while 70% of users need to watch a video tutorial to understand how an app or website works.

Here are some best practices for designing an effective user onboarding experience.

## 1. Welcome the user
Introduce the user to the product in a way that is easy to understand and does not overwhelm them with too much information at once.

Some elements that are typically included in a welcome experience are:

- A welcome message or greeting that introduces the user to the product or service and sets the tone for the onboarding experience.
- An overview of the product or service, including its key features and benefits, and showing the user how to perform basic tasks.
- A brief walkthrough to guide the user around the main page and get started with a primary task.

Overall, the goal of user onboarding is to provide the user with a smooth and enjoyable introduction to the product or service, and give them the knowledge and confidence they need to start using it effectively.

## 2. Use visuals
Using visuals in user onboarding can help make the onboarding experience more engaging.

Some ways to incorporate visuals into your onboarding process include:

1. Using images and illustrations to explain key concepts and features. Visuals can make complex ideas easier to understand and remember, and can help users quickly grasp the key points of the product or service.
1. Using videos to show the product or service in action. Videos can provide a more immersive and engaging experience than text or images alone, and can be a great way to demonstrate how the product or service works and what it can do.
1. Using animations to highlight important elements and transitions. Animations can help draw the user’s attention to important parts of the user interface, and can make the onboarding experience more interactive and engaging.

## 3. Be interactive
Some users prefer to interact with the product rather than simply passively reading text or watching a video.

Here are some ways to make your onboarding process interactive:

1. Use quizzes, games, and challenges to test the user’s knowledge and skills. These can help users learn and retain information, and can provide a sense of accomplishment and progress.
1. Use interactive tutorials and step-by-step guides that allow users to try out the product or service as they go along. This can help users understand how the product or service works, and can make the onboarding experience more hands-on and engaging.
1. Use branching or personalized scenarios to tailor the onboarding experience to the user’s needs and preferences. This can help you provide a more personalized and relevant experience, and can increase the chances of the user becoming a long-term user.

## 4. Measure performance
To analyze the performance of a product’s onboarding process, you can use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data.

Here are some steps you can follow to conduct a thorough analysis of your user onboarding process:

1. Identify the key metrics you want to track: These could include things like the completion rate of key task flows, the time it takes users to complete these tasks, the number of users who complete the onboarding process and become active users, and the number of users who drop off or abandon the onboarding process.
1. Collect data on these metrics: You can use tools such as analytics software and customer feedback platforms to collect data on these metrics. Make sure to collect data over a sufficient period of time to get a representative sample.
1. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods and visualization techniques to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns. Look for areas where the user onboarding process is performing well, and areas where there may be room for improvement.
1. Identify potential improvements: Based on the data and analysis, identify potential improvements to the user onboarding process that could help improve the user experience and increase the completion or adoption rate.
1. Implement the improvements: Iterate on your onboarding process and track the results to see if your metrics improve. Continuously monitor and track the performance of the user onboarding process to identify any additional areas for improvement.

## 5. Provide helpful resources
Providing resources during user onboarding can help users get access to the support they need to succeed.

Here are some examples of resources:

1. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) can provide users with answers to common questions and concerns, and can help them quickly find solutions to any problems they may encounter.
1. Support forums and communities can connect users to a network of other users and experts who can provide help and support, and can offer a sense of community and belonging.
1. Chatbots or virtual assistants can provide users with access to live support, and can help them resolve any issues or concerns they may have.

## 6. Get feedback
Ask for user feedback on the onboarding experience to find out what worked well and what could be improved. This can help you refine the onboarding process and make it more effective.

Here are some ways to ask for feedback during user onboarding:

1. Send out surveys or polls to ask the user specific questions about their experience with the product or service. These can provide quantitative data that can be analyzed and used to identify areas for improvement.
1. Use open-ended feedback forms to ask the user for general feedback and comments on their experience with the product or service, and can provide qualitative data that can be used to understand the user’s perspective and experiences in more depth.
1. Use in-app feedback tools that can be integrated into the product itself. These make it easier and more convenient for users to provide feedback, and some can generate real-time insights that can be used to inform your next iteration.
