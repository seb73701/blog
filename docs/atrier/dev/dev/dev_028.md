One of the challenges faced by a Data Analyst/ Data Scientist is how to bring their ideas to life. There are a lot of things to consider when creating a dashboard report which I will explain in this article using the three-stage PDF(Planning, Designing, and Feedback) design method that I have adopted over the years.

Here are the highlights of the PDF method;

## Planning
The first step is to know the goal of the business. As a data analyst, you must understand the overall objectives of building a dashboard for reporting and insight gathering. During the planning phase, it is important that you know the following:

### 1. What metrics are you considering for business?
Organizations always want to track the overall performance of the business through key metrics. As a data analyst, it is important that you help these organizations know their business position and how to leverage data to scale up in this dynamic business environment.

### 2. Who is going to be your audience?
Understanding your audience is key to creating an outstanding dashboard. Information can be passed to your audience using different visual representations, but it is imperative to know your audience and how best to get their attention. For example, a report used at a tech conference of experienced experts might not be applicable in a high school outreach program.

### 3. What decisions do you want the stakeholders to make from your dashboard?

The end goal of any business intelligence analysis is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. Whoever the end-user of your report is, you expect them to be able to make informed decisions from your analysis.

### 4. How self-explanatory is your dashboard?

As a data analyst, you want your report to be clear and concise. Avoid reporting irrelevant and unnecessary information that may come off as noise. The stakeholders should be able to comprehend your findings and make data-driven decisions from your report.


## Designing
The designing phase will require you to be more technical in your approach to answering the business questions. Here are key things to pay attention to;

### 1. What size and orientation will I be using?
At this point I utilized a lot of tools, starting with doing a mock-up of the dashboard design and layout on paper. This is the first phase of bringing my ideas to life. Then, I move forward to building a canva of the whole dashboard framework using any tool of my choice.

### 2. What type of charts will I use?

The type of charts you utilize to convey your result depends on the analysis. You must adopt the best visuals that can clearly communicate your findings to your audience. Every facet of your graphics should primarily serve the goal of presenting the information.

### 3. What standard procedure did the organization ask me to follow if any?

Every organization has a set standard format for reporting. Aside from the specific business questions, organizations have color themes, fonts, icons, and other operating guidelines that one must follow. Even popular data analytics challenges have set rules and tasks set out for all participants.

### 4. Accessibility: Do your dashboard themes/color pallets consider people that have color blindness?

Colors are powerful, it has this way of communicating information to our brains quickly even before we become aware of other contexts of the visual. According to COQUAL 2021 report, about 30% of white-collar employees in the US have a disability. In fact, 62% of these employees with disabilities said it is not visible to others just by looking at them. Moreover, these employees might not tell you about their disability because more than a third of these employees have experienced discrimination in their current workplace. Also, the Power BI app November 2022 update encouraged accessibility by changing its theme color from accent to teal to accommodate people with disabilities.

> One of the solutions I came up with for improving accessibility is the use of a colour contrast analyzer and utilizing the We Are Colorblind Website to ensure my visuals are accessible to all.

## Feedback
Lastly, the feedback phase could also be an avenue to do a pre-presentation test with your colleagues and get real-time feedback. This phase is the best opportunity to improve your dashboard report performance, and this avenue can help you get direct feedback from the stakeholders.
