# 2 Form Design UX Tips
I have been doing quite a bit of form design in my current UX/UI role, and I wanted to share a few things I have learned so far.

## 1. Make the form look easy to fill in
This sounds like an unusual thing to say, as you will probably be thinking of ways to actually make your form easier to fill in. Not just making it look easier.

But in general, nobody really enjoys filling out forms. They can be time-consuming, confusing and feel repetitive.

So it is important that we don't scare users off before they have even started filling in the form.

Here are a few ways of doing this:


### Only ask what is necessary
This one is crucial. The best way to make a form look easier to fill is to make it shorter.

The length of a form can have a significant impact on the conversion rate. As seeing a long form will quickly make the user perceive that this form will take a lot of time and effort that they may not feel is worth the reward of filling the form in.

Go through your question and ask if each one is essential to have on the form.

### Split up long forms
If your form has to be long, think about splitting it into smaller sections.

For example, when you are buying something, many checkout processes will split the form into sections like address, payment, and confirmation.

### Start with easy questions.
Start with simple questions like name and email before getting to some of the more complicated or time-consuming questions like inputting card payment information.

Once the user has gotten started, they will be less likely to drop off when there is a more challenging question as they already have invested some time and effort into the form.

## 2. Make the form actually easier to fill in
### Labelling
Where we place the label for an input field is important for how easy it is to scan the questions. This can also affect the time it takes to fill it in.

There are pros and cons to all the different ways of labelling fields but in general, putting the label above the input and aligning it to the left performs well. It's easy to scan down, and you don't have to keep looking from left to right.

### Structure column / path
When designing the layout, stick to using a single column. When you have two columns, users can interpret the order of filling out the fields differently. This could mess up the flow of answering questions if the user doesn't follow the intended order.

Also, a single column gives a clear path to completion. The user can follow the questions down, leading to the action button at the end.

### Input Types
When a user needs to input information, it is important to think about the different methods we could use and which will be the quickest and most accessible for a user.

If you need a user to select an option and there are less than 6 options to choose from. It can be best to stay away from dropdown menus. This is because they hide the options from the user until they click on it.

This is adding an extra click and hiding important information for the user.

Other methods to consider are radio buttons or toggle buttons for 3–5 options and check boxes and toggle switches for 1–2 options.

### Error handling
Use inline error handling. This lets the user see and fix errors as soon as they happen.

This lets the user quickly fix the error straight away rather than getting to the end of a form and then finding out they have an error. They will then need to scroll back through to find where the error was made and re-read the question.

With everything in UX, there are never any 100% correct ways to do something. It can depend on the purpose of the site or platform you are designing for and who theusers are.

These tips have come from what I have learned from reading research and my experience so far. So I hope they were helpful.
