Telling a story is a very important part of any Data Scientist’s job. In this article I go through the key theory of Data Visualization.

## Introduction
Knowing how to tell a story efficiently is one of the hardest skills to master as a data scientist. Data visualization theory, although less sexy than other Data Science domains like machine learning, is arguably the most important part of a Data Scientist’s role. I see Data Scientists everywhere make visualizations that could be significantly improved by using some of the theory in this post.

In this article, I want to discuss some of the key aspects of data visualization. I will talk about the ways to visually encode information, and some of the key principles developed by psychologists throughout the history of this field. I finish off with some famous visualizations that helped shape the field.

Throughout the article, I’ll give examples of good and bad ways to visualize data, and I hope after reading this you too can avoid making visualizations like the monstrosity on top of this article.

## What is Data Visualization?
The ultimate goal of data visualization is to tell a story. We are trying to convey information about the data as efficiently as possible. Visualizing means encoding information about the data in a graphical way. Doing this well allows the reader can quickly and accurately understand the message we are trying to transmit.

## Visual encodings
There are many ways to encode information. In data visualization we use visual encodings. I’ll quickly go through some:

## Retinal Visual Encodings
The most common way to encode information is through retinal encodings. These encodings are quickly picked up by our retina and are a way to transmit information to the reader.

![1_cbzt_hlnnltxkp4oqx7olw.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_cbzt_hlnnltxkp4oqx7olw.webp)
*Figure. Retinal Encodings*

Above are 5 retinal encodings, these include shade, color, size, orientation and shape. You could use all of them in one chart but it would be hard for the reader to grasp all the information quickly. 1 or 2 retinal encodings per chart is optimal.

Think about what encodings are best for what kind of variable. For example, color would work pretty badly for a continuous variable (example: age or weight), but would work very well for a discrete variable (example: sex or nationality). I’ll discuss this in more detail later.

## Other Visual Encodings
Aside from retinal encodings, there are other visual encodings that can be used to visualize data. For example “spatial” encodings exploit the cortex’s spatial awareness to encode information. This kind of encoding can be achieved through position in a scale, length, area and volume.

## What’s the best encoding?
But what is the best way to encode data? The simple answer is it depends on what you’re trying to achieve. Take a look at the following chart of the effectiveness of encodings for continuous variables:

![1_eufemrzo4q_ez-t-bswo5q.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_eufemrzo4q_ez-t-bswo5q.webp)
*Figure. Visual encoding effectiveness for continuous variables*


The chart above shows effectiveness for continuous variable encodings (weight, height etc.). The best is position on a common scale, the worst is volume. Think about the 3D pie chart at the beginning of this article, and how difficult it is to know the values in each category purely based on the volume.

T. Munzner suggests encoding your most important variables with the visual encodings with the highest effectiveness as shown in the figure above. Keep in mind this is for continuous variables, and whilst color might not be the best representative for continuous variables it certainly works well with discrete:

![1_rtw-im4lvus43di7nvrlcq.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_rtw-im4lvus43di7nvrlcq.webp)
*Figure. Visual encoding effectiveness for discrete variables*

For discrete variables (gender, race etc.), the spatial region encoding is the most effective, color is the second best visual encoding.

Let’s look at an example:

![1_-uzykfa-v1zzlb3f2idtdw.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_-uzykfa-v1zzlb3f2idtdw.webp)
*Figure. Population of China and USA as volume of cubes*

The figure above shows the population of China and USA. The population is encoded in volume, whilst category is encoded in color. Color works very well here for the discrete variable, however, volume is a terrible choice because it is really difficult for the reader to know exactly what population each country has.

![1_vvgi3_k30sejobcehmk5qa.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_vvgi3_k30sejobcehmk5qa.webp)
*Figure. Population of China and USA as a bar chart*

Now let’s look at a bar chart. Here we are using 2 encodings for the continuous variable, and o 1 encoding for the discrete. For the continuous variable (population), the encodings used are the position in a common scale and the length. For the discrete variable (class membership), we are using spatial region instead of color, which works best.

## Stacked Bar Charts and Pie Charts
Is there any proof that all of this is true? Or is this all subjective?

William S. Cleaveland and Robert McGill conducted a series of experiments to try to quantify the efficacity of different ways to encode data visually [2].

![1_88asfky5facjuznvrd0uka.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_88asfky5facjuznvrd0uka.webp)
*Figure. Visualization types in William S. Cleaveland and Robert McGill experiment [2]*

In William S. Cleaveland and Robert McGill’s experiment 55 subjects were given 20 graphs of the types above and were asked to respond to 2 questions:

- Which bar is larger
- What percentage is the smaller bar of the larger bar

A similar experiment was performed on pie charts and bar charts:

![1_zxo2rqqaz2k0ialjtsvhyw.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_zxo2rqqaz2k0ialjtsvhyw.webp)
*Figure. Angle vs Length visualization types by William S. Cleaveland and Robert McGill experiment [2]*

Here are the results:

![1_rkheeo-kzcr7czdzijumoq.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_rkheeo-kzcr7czdzijumoq.webp)
*Figure. Error rates for types of visualizations by William S. Cleaveland and Robert McGill [2]*

The visualization resulting in the least error is the scaled bar chart. Notice that stacked bar charts are a lot harder to compare and errors are much greater. Looking back to the encodings, position on an unaligned scale is less effective than position on an aligned scale.

The second part of Fig. 8 shows that bar charts have on average half the error of pie charts (2⁰’⁹⁶ ≈ 2). This is once again represented in Fig. 2 where angle is much less effective at encoding information than position on a common scale.

Going back to the 3D pie chart at the beginning of the article, you can start to see why angle is just not the best way to encode data, and volume makes no sense either. A bar chart achieves the same thing but better.

## Gestalt Theory
The gestalt principles (German for shape) were developed by 20th-century psychologists to understand patterns in human visual perception. I won’t talk about all gestalt principles, however, I wanted to mention a few.

To show Gestalt theory, I am going to plot a grid of blue circles, I am then going to add each principle to the grid. Think about how these principles interact with each other.

## Similarity
Gestalt similarity highlights the brain’s ability to categorize things into groups. Similarity can happen due to any visual encoding like position, shape, color, size, etc.

![1_vaiy9lwvj0eec6tgdqu9-w.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_vaiy9lwvj0eec6tgdqu9-w.webp)
*Figure. Gestalt Similarity *

Looking at the image above you should see different groups. This is your brain associating the shapes together.

## Non-similarity

![1_gpyd6wk1urucdqi-d14xww.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_gpyd6wk1urucdqi-d14xww.webp)
*Figure. Gestalt non-similarity*

Here most people’s eyes immediately jump to the dot on the left Non-similarity is powerful but also dangerous. By placing that dot outside the grid, you almost can’t tell that I left in the other shapes inside the grid.

## Connectedness

![1_5xsu7v1azvn3_jqlgfi59a.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_5xsu7v1azvn3_jqlgfi59a.webp)
*Figure. Gestalt Connectedness*

Connectedness is even more powerful, your eyes immediately shoot for the line. In fact, the 6 dots connected by the line have different shapes, but we still see them as a group. Connectedness can overpower similarity and non-similarity.

So the Gestalt principles and their interactions are important to consider when making visualizations.

## Tufte’s Information to Ink Ratio
This is my favorite part of data visualization theory. Edward Tufte is an American statistician and a pioneer in data visualization. Some of Tufte’s principles are very controversial. Tufte has a very radical view of what makes a visualization good.

![1_1bibyaebwxbpi57gusne4a.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_1bibyaebwxbpi57gusne4a.webp)
*Figure. Equation 1: Tufte’s data to ink ratio*

Tufte believes when designing a graph you should maximize the data to ink ratio. We should only use ink to represent data, and as little ink as possible.

![1_vkadh5ei3y3bq7wjmnl4wa.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_vkadh5ei3y3bq7wjmnl4wa.webp)
*Figure. Tufte Data-Ink Ratio Visualized*

Tufte strictly believes in this data in ratio, and all the ink that is not necessary to visualize the data should be avoided entirely. In the figure above I have obviously exaggerated things a bit, but you get the point. The figure on the left has lots of clutter and it distracts the reader from what we really want to see. The figure on the right is better, showing the data with no added noise.

## Famous Visualizations
I want to finish off with a few famous visualizations.

The first one represents the size of “La Grande Armée” throughout Napoleon’s innovation of Russia in 1812–1813. The army set off with approximately 600,000 men and a small fraction of them made it out.

![1_vnjlrfaoomd9_je93pnpaq.gif](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_vnjlrfaoomd9_je93pnpaq.gif)
*Figure. Napoleon’s March to Moscow. Image by Charles Joseph Minard [3]*

What makes this visualization is impressive is that it captures 6 aspects of the data: number of troops, distance, temperature, geographical position, the direction of travel, and location vs time.

The second one I want to show is by Florence Nightingale, an English social reformer and a statistician in the 19th century. The diagram shows the causes of mortality of the army in the east.

![1__bamh3cgkqnpo7z-zk0gzq.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1__bamh3cgkqnpo7z-zk0gzq.webp)
*Figure. Cause of Mortality amongst soldiers in the East- Nightingale Rose — Image by Florence Nightingale [4]*

This graph shows that most of the deaths in the army in the east were preventable (in blue). Her goal was to show the importance of sanitation in army hospitals. Her campaigns worked and after 10 years of sanitary reforms the mortality rate of the army in India dropped by over a factor of 3.

What do you think about these visualizations? Would you have visualized the data differently?

## What makes a Visualization Good?
I think it’s important to keep Tufte’s data-ink ratio in mind, but up to a point. It is important to be efficient with the amount of ink on a graph to not distract the reader, but it shouldn’t compromise the graph’s readability. Think of the data to ink ratio in the 3D pie chart. Think of the kinds of visual encodings used (volume, angle, color). A bar chart achieves the same thing, but way more efficiently.

![1_en6yeiqm7xow-txzgqjhbg.webp](/assets/img/developpement/tempo/1_en6yeiqm7xow-txzgqjhbg.webp)
*Figure. Bar Chart vs Pie Chart*

In some cases, it makes sense to trade effectiveness to create an impression. The nightingale rose uses angles and area as visual encodings which are both inefficient. In her case, it works well because the number of preventable deaths is massive. Her graph highlights this without disclosing accurate numbers, and this helped shape public opinion.

## Conclusion
In this article, I first talk about the kinds of visual encodings that you use when making visualizations without even realizing it. I talk about their effectiveness, and which ones you should avoid. I then talk a bit more on theory including Gestalt theory and Tufte. To finish I show you some famous visualizations that helped shape the field of data visualization.
