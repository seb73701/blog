# UI Design: The Process
How to effectively transition from UX artifacts to UI design.

## Overview
While UX represents what your users want, why they want it, and how you’re going help them get it, UI represents what your users will see and interact with throughout the process of your product or service.

That said, sometimes it can be a little tricky moving from experience design into interface design smoothly, especially if you’re working on a larger team.

Today, I want to share with you how to effectively transition from UX artifacts to UI design.

## Converting UX goals to UI elements
Starting off, we want to convert the goals that we’ve identified in our UX research and design processes into UI elements that help drive these necessary outcomes.

In order to do that, we generally will list these goals in terms of features required to make them a reality.

This particular approach is known as the “jobs-to-be-done” framework, and is one that I personally recommend, as it can help make it much more clear what exactly you and your team need to be focusing on during the UI design process.

## The phases of UI design
It’s relatively common knowledge that, much like the phases of UX design, UI design also has multiple phases which facilitate the conception, iteration, rendition, and revision of interface compositions for testing and continuous improvement.

Generally speaking, the common phases of UI design (not UX design) are as-follows:

- Wireframing
- Interface blocking
- Content application
- Low, medium, hi-fi mockups
- Prototyping
- Design specification
- Handoff/implementation

That said, it is worth mentioning that there can be quite a bit of overlap between UX artifacts and UI design processes, and generally speaking this will happen somewhere between information architecture and the wireframing process.

The trick here is understanding on a team level who is responsible for what, and when. Without a shared understanding of what constitutes responsibility for each part of the process within your team, it can be very difficult to make meaningful progress, which is why it’s important to outline those responsibilities at the outset for clarity wherever possible.

## Specification of UI elements & Layout
After all of your artifacts are in a row from your UX processes, the next step is generating low or mid-fidelity compositions of your UI using atomic design and component-based architecture.

The reason this is so important is because it gives you global control over the atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages of your design, from the ultra-specific, all the way to the most general.

Blocking out your UI elements using a 4/8pt grid with columns, margins, and gutters clearly defined is exceptionally important, and when combined with atomic design, can help you achieve a uniform look and feel for your UI.

## Prototyping and testing handoff
Now this last step if going to depend a lot on your team, if you have a dedicated user researcher, or if you are a UI/UX team of one.

Essentially, once you’ve got your mocks together in as high of a fidelity as is reasonable, you want to create your prototypes, and then hand them off to your UX designer for testing (or run usability tests on them yourself.

## Bringing it all together
So what does all this mean for you?

To start, we want to convert the goals that we’ve identified in our UX research and design processes into UI elements that help drive these necessary outcomes using the “jobs-to-be-done” framework.

After that, the the common phases of UI design (not UX design) are as-follows:

- Wireframing
- Interface blocking
- Content application
- Low, medium, hi-fi mockups
- Prototyping
- Design specification
- Handoff/implementation

Following your UX design artifacts, you’ll want to create and iterate on your UI design concepts, refining as you go.

Finally, once you’re satisfied with your designs in as high of a fidelity as is reasonable, you want to create your prototypes, and then hand them off to your UX designer for testing (or run usability tests on them yourself.

This approach can help you and your team create much higher impact UI designs, and can make it easier to iterate on them in a continuous fashion using the data you get from testing to make them even better.
