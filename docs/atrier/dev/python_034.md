# Building Secure Python Applications: Best Practices and Security Considerations

A high-level programming language such as Python lets you structure your codebase however you like, which may create safety loopholes when security practices aren’t followed.

Writing secure code adds to the essential steps in building software since it allows the developer to protect the data and ensures the consistent behavior of the program.

No matter the number of developers working on it or if it is a small or comprehensive application, security vulnerabilities are a major possibility.

How do you ensure the security of your Python application?

This is where implementing Best Python Practices and Security considerations to build Python applications comes into frame. This article comes as the best strategies for developing secure Python applications.

## 9 Python Security Best Practices To Secure Your Application
Before deploying your Python-based application, we’ve compiled a list of top best practices to help you build a powerful but secure one.

## Keep Python up-to-date
Keeping the Python version upto date is essential practice for developing secure Python applications. When you keep the version up to date, you will prevent cyber criminals and attackers.

New versions are meant to prevent bugs, add a layer of security to the application compared to previous versions, and introduce some new features. Furthermore, everyone must use the same version if working on a collaborative project with multiple people.

Some differences between Python 2 and 3 will not allow you to run Python 2 code in Python 3. There are several issues that this may raise for developers, as upgrading to the latest version of Python may require them to either write or modify a great deal of code.

## Make use of a virtual environment.
A virtual environment should always be used when developing Python projects. It helps avoid conflict between Python modules and ensures that the same modules are used on local and production machines.

With a virtual environment, it will be possible to ensure malicious Python dependencies cannot be shipped to production through pip freeze to generate requirements.txt.

## Check the licenses of your dependencies.
Another critical practice for developing secure Python applications is checking the dependency of the licenses. Open-source projects always require a license, so knowing how they are licensed is essential.

There are a lot of open-source projects available to use for free, but sometimes there are a few conditions attached that need to be met. Terms can relate to how the software will be used, whether or not changes can be made, and so on. You must learn about the open-source licenses needed to use the projects to avoid getting involved in anything illegal.

## Safely import packages
Whenever you work with external or internal Python modules, import them correctly and use the correct paths. Paths in Python can either be absolute or relative.

- Absolute path. Starting from the file system root, this path indicates the process where the given directory can be accessed.
- Relative path. This path shows the location of direction in regard to the location of the Python script.

## Python String Formatting
Python comes with one of the stellar string formatting methods, which is known to advance the security of your applications. But if you implement it right, you might end up building a security hole.

F-strings and str.format() in Python3 let you flexibly format strings. Thus, this can invite the chances of data mining.

User-controlled format strings can be misused for leaking sensitive data in Python applications.

## Safely handle Python HTTP requests.
To prevent security issues when creating Python projects that involve sending HTTP requests, it is essential to know how the library handles security before sending HTTP requests.

With HTTP request libraries like Requests, you should avoid putting versions down in requirements.txt to avoid installing outdated and vulnerable versions.

## Keep an eye out for exploited and malicious packages.
By utilizing packages, you can save time by avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel each time. The Pip package makes it easy to install packages. Using them has several advantages, including saving time, making your codebase more compact and smaller, making application design easier, and providing improved performance.

Unlike other code repositories, PyPI does not undergo any security review or checking before publishing Python Packages.

## Keep SQL injections at bay.
How does someone inject SQL into a database? This program aims to destroy millions of poorly-programmed websites in the hope that enough people will click through to their affiliate sites to earn commissions.

SQL injections may also allow sensitive data to be dropped from insecure tables. As a result, SQL injections should be taken seriously, and updated procedures should be followed to protect your database.

## Update Your Python Packages to Address Open Source Vulnerabilities
Having the most recent updates to the open source that contains the fix for the vulnerability is the easiest method of preventing and eliminating open source vulnerabilities. Developers and community members with a common goal can build, contribute, and publish software in an open-source environment for the greater good of the community.

It is possible that security loopholes can pop up, which can have very dangerous consequences for any software or applications using the project.

As a result, open-source vulnerabilities are always reported to the developers as soon as they are discovered, usually in the form of a security patch.

You will be more secure if you stay updated with the latest version of the open-source package as soon as possible. Ensure you know the vulnerabilities of the open-source package you are using, so you will know when to upgrade to the latest version.

## Conclusion
Securing your Python code is quite easy if you follow the basic rules and practices. Unfortunately, many developers do not consider this since they are simply concerned with delivering and meeting their tasks rather than taking the time to think about vulnerabilities in the future.

When creating a Python project, it is always recommended to keep these practices in mind as you write your code. Besides that, you also have a choice to choose a professional Python development services provider and get the potential results.
