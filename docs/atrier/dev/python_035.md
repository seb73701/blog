[Python](https://www.python.org/) has emerged as one of the [most popular programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in the world, offering fast work processes, clean design, and transparent functionality. The benefits of Python are just too many: versatility, ease of use, and extensive library support have made it a go-to choice for developers across various industries. Not even mentioning it’s free, open-source, and the community is vibrant. Let’s dive deep into the advantages of using Python for app development, [why is Python used for almost any industry](https://hackernoon.com/why-python-possibilities-and-use-cases), some limitations, and look at actual [apps written in Python](https://incora.software/insights/apps-written-in-python#what-is-special-about-python).

## Python Background
Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991, as an interpreted, dynamic, and high-level programming language. Unlike the languages before that when you had to be highly proficient to learn programming, Python started with simplicity and readability in mind. So, the lower learning curve compared to other programming languages makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers. Python’s basic syntax is easy to understand (many describe it as writing simple commands in English), allowing developers to focus on the logic and functionality of their code. The developers that worked with programming languages like Java or C languages say that its abstractions are too flexible or not specific enough.

Backend development is the most effective use of this high-level and general-purpose programming language. Along with such frameworks for back-end web development as Flask and Django, a wide variety of [applications are built in Python](https://djangostars.com/blog/top-seven-apps-built-python/) (or have it as a part of code).

## What are the Benefits of Using Python?
According to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/13/developer-survey-results-are-in/), Python is the most preferred language which means that the majority of developers use it. [Python is usually one person’s work](https://pythoninstitute.org/about-python), unlike most programming languages for back-end development. Let’s see the other benefits of Python.

### Easy to Learn and Use
One of the biggest pros of using Python for app development is its ease of learning and use. The syntax is simple and the structure encourages clean code. A lot of developers [learn to program with Python](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/reasons-why-python-popular-with-developers/), and then take other languages. Python’s readability powers developers to write code that is easy to understand and maintain, reducing bugs and errors. Ease of use is among the most frequently named advantages of using Python for developers with diverse programming skills, letting them to build robust and efficient applications.

### Versatile and Scalable
Versatility and scalability are coming next when we talk about the advantages of using Python for app development. It can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (which is extremely hype now). Python’s [extensive library support](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-programming-so-scalable) comes with a vast collection of pre-built modules and tools, so devs can pick existing solutions and speed up the development significantly.

The Python community actively develops and maintains libraries, frameworks, and tools, thus giving a wide range of resources and support to less experienced developers.

## Limitations of Python
While Python offers a great deal of advantages, it also has some limitations that developers should consider. One of the notable limitations of Python is its performance compared to languages like C++ or Java. Python’s interpreted nature and dynamic typing [can result in slower execution speed](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-is-python-so-slow-and-how-to-speed-it-up-485b5a84154e), making it less suitable for intensive tasks or real-time applications. It is mainly slowed by adding a considerable amount of code in other programming languages.

Among the limitations of Python is its [Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)](https://realpython.com/python-gil/), which can hinder the execution of multiple threads in parallel. This limitation can impact the performance of multi-threaded applications that rely heavily on CPU-bound tasks. However, Python offers [alternatives like asynchronous programming](https://incora.software/insights/python-asynchronous-programming) to overcome the limitation.

## Real-World Applications of Python
