> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> **Couchbase** is the modern database for enterprise applications. **Couchbase** is a distributed, JSON document database, with all the desired capabilities of a relational DBMS. It is a robust database, built for microservices and serverless consumption-based computing on the cloud on one end, and edge computing for occasionally and locally connected edge Mobile/IoT devices on the other.
>
> **Couchbase** manages JSON documents, eliminating the need for a hard coded schema in the database. The application object definition, available within JSON, is the schema controlled by the developer.
> 
> Developers write the JSON once into this database and apply multiple data processing capabilities on it. In addition to the SQL-like programmability, **Couchbase** offers caching, key- value store, full-text search (for information retrieval), analytics (for ad-hoc querying), and Event driven (reactive) programming on this single copy of data.
> 
> **Couchbase** is designed to interleave transactions with these high-performance operations at large scale. Developers are offered the freedom to pay the price of a transaction only when needed. Consequently, **Couchbase** can serve as a reliable system of record, while concurrently handling key-value operations of microseconds latency, SQL queries and text searches in milliseconds, and ad-hoc analytical queries spanning tens of seconds, one not impeding the other.
> 
> These unique design choices in **Couchbase** lead to reduced data sprawl, improved security, decreased administration, and lower cost. But most importantly, it enables developers to write applications once and deploy them at any scale.
>
> **Couchbase**’s distributed streaming architecture is designed for no single point of failure. This enables elastic scaling, resource fencing as well as instantaneous data replication for high- availability, global geo-distribution, and disaster-recovery. The result is a database that is resilient, cost-efficient, and built for metered usage. This cloud-native architecture combined with Kubernetes (K8s) delivers a self-managed autonomous database.
> 
> **Couchbase** is:
> 
> - A distributed database. No more scaling or availability issues.
> - A cache and a database. No more cache invalidation or coherency issues.
> - A database and a search engine. No more crawlers.
> - An operational and an analytical database. No more ETL.
> - A desktop, mobile, and clusterable database. No compromises between Server and Mobile.
>
> **Couchbase** is the modern database for Cloud and Edge. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-rotate-180"></i>
