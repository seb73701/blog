> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> **Rundeck** is runbook automation that gives you and your colleagues self-service access to the processes and tools they need to get their job done.
>
> When used for incident management, **Rundeck** will help you have shorter incidents and fewer escalations.
>
> When used for general operations work, **Rundeck** will help alleviate the time-consuming and repetitive toil that currently consumes too much of your team's time.
>
> With **Rundeck**, it is simple and easy to create workflows (called "jobs") from any of your existing tools or scripts. Trigger **Rundeck** jobs from the Web GUI, API, CLI, or by schedule. **Rundeck**'s access control features make it easy to safely delegate control of tasks to those traditionally outside of operations.
> 
> **Rundeck** was designed to accept the reality that heterogeneous infrastructure and tooling are a fact of life in any sizable organization. That is why **Rundeck** doesn't make you replace the scripts, commands, or tools you use today. You use **Rundeck** to execute workflows across your existing automation (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, legacy tools, and all of your custom scripts/APIs) or quickly automate previously manual procedures. With **Rundeck** you can reuse the automation skills you already have and add new ones as needed.
>
> Out of the box, **Rundeck** gives you capabilities that would be expensive to develop and maintain in-house: workflow control, scheduling, error-handling, logging, access control, option passing, log filtering, web GUI, REST API (with CLI tools) and integration with external sources for authentication, resource model, and option data. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-rotate-180"></i>
