> It allows you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and perform database management operations no matter where they are located on-prem or in the cloud.
>
> **PMM** collects thousands of out-of-the-box performance metrics from databases and their hosts.
>
> The **PMM** web UI visualizes data in dashboards.
>
> Additional features include advisors for database health assessments. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-rotate-180"></i>
