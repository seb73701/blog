> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> **OpenSearch** is a distributed search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. After adding your data to **OpenSearch**, you can perform full-text searches on it with all of the features you might expect: search by field, search multiple indexes, boost fields, rank results by score, sort results by field, and aggregate results.
>
> Unsurprisingly, people often use search engines like **OpenSearch** as the backend for a search applicationâ€”think Wikipedia or an online store. It offers excellent performance and can scale up and down as the needs of the application grow or shrink.
>
> An equally popular, but less obvious use case is log analytics, in which you take the logs from an application, feed them into **OpenSearch**, and use the rich search and visualization functionality to identify issues. For example, a malfunctioning web server might throw a 500 error 0.5% of the time, which can be hard to notice unless you have a real-time graph of all HTTP status codes that the server has thrown in the past four hours. You can use **OpenSearch** Dashboards to build these sorts of visualizations from data in **OpenSearch**. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-rotate-180"></i>
