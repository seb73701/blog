> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> **Keepalived** is a routing software written in C. The main goal of this project is to provide simple and robust facilities for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux system and Linux based infrastructures. Loadbalancing framework relies on well-known and widely used Linux Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing Layer4 loadbalancing. **Keepalived** implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage loadbalanced server pool according their health. On the other hand high-availability is achieved by VRRP protocol. VRRP is a fundamental brick for router failover. In addition, **Keepalived** implements a set of hooks to the VRRP finite state machine providing low-level and high-speed protocol interactions. In order to offer fastest network failure detection, **Keepalived** implements BFD protocol. VRRP state transition can take into account BFD hint to drive fast state transition. **Keepalived** frameworks can be used independently or all together to provide resilient infrastructures. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-rotate-180"></i>
